# Handwritten Digit Recognizer ✍️🔢

This is a browser-based **Handwritten Digit Recognizer** built with **TensorFlow.js**.  
You can draw digits (0–9) on the canvas, and the AI model will predict them in real-time 🚀

## 🚀 Features
- Draw digits directly in the browser 🖌️  
- Predicts handwritten numbers (0–9) instantly 🔢  
- Option to train the model in-browser or use a pre-trained model 🤖  
- Save & load trained models for later use 💾  
- Built entirely with **JavaScript + TensorFlow.js** (no backend needed)  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **TensorFlow.js** – Machine learning in the browser  
- **JavaScript (ES6)**  
- **HTML5 Canvas** – Drawing area for digits  

## 📸 Demo
1. Open the app in your browser  
2. Draw any digit (0–9) on the canvas  
3. Click **Predict** → The AI will show its best guess
